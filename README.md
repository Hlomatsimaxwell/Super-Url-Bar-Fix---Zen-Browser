# Zen Browser - Super URL Bar Mod (Restored)

This is a workaround to restore the **Super URL Bar** mod that was recently removed from Zen Browser.

## üîß What This Repo Contains

- `chrome.css`: Custom styles for the Zen Browser URL bar (rounded corners, blur effects, icon behavior, etc.)
- `preferences.json`: (Optional) User preferences to enable related features.

## üì¶ How to Install

1. **Download any random Zen mod** from [Zen Mods](https://zen-browser.app/mods/).
2. Navigate to the following folder on your system:

C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\zen\Profiles[your-profile-name]\chrome\zen-themes[mod-id]


3. Replace the existing `chrome.css` in that mod folder with the one from this repo.

4. Optionally, apply the `preferences.json` file for preferred behavior (like enabling center-aligned text or blur effects).

## üí° Notes

- This is a user-made workaround and not an official fix.
- All credits go to [@Azarath7](https://github.com/Azarath7) for discovering and sharing this method. See [issue #6874](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues/6874#issuecomment-2764679448).
- This should remain functional until major changes to Zen‚Äôs theming system occur.
